// THIS VERSION OF THE FILE HAS ERRORS
// DO NOT USE THIS VERSION OF THE FILE FOR THE RUNNING OR SUBMISSION OF THE ASSIGNMENT

// 1. Problem Description
// Consider that has this kind of scenario: two villages (Eastvillage and Westvillage) only have a
// single-lane road for the connection. People from these two villages only can use this road for
// exchange or share their produce. The road can be deadlocked if a people from either East or West
// on the road simultaneously. To solve this problem to avoid deadlock, please design an algorithm
// that uses semaphores and/or mutex locks. There have no concerns for the starvation cases.
// Implement your solution using synchronization tools. In particular, represent the people at
// Eastvillage and Westvillage as separate threads (east_village.java and west_village.java). Once a
// people is on the road, the associated thread will sleep for a random period of time, representing
// traveling across the road. You should design a new action for each people when they get into the
// road, such as eat a donut, to wait for some time. Design your program so that you can create several
// threads representing the two villagesâ€™ people without deadlock in the road.
// You can flexibly design the algorithm, the test should have no deadlock in the multiple execution
// cases.
// 2. The Required Deliverable Materials
// (1) A README file, which describes how we can compile and run your code.
// (2) Your source code, should submit in the required format.
// (3) Your short report, which discusses the design of your program.
// (4) A recorded video shows the output and runtime
// 3. Submission Requirements
// You need to strictly follow the instructions listed below:
// 1) This is a group project, please submit a .zip/.rar file that contains all files, only one submission
// from one group.
// 2) Make a video to record your code execution and outputs. The video should present your name
// or time as identification (You are suggested to upload the video to YouTube and put the link into
// your report).
// 3) The submission should include your source code and project report. Do not submit your binary
// code. Project report should contain your groupmates name and ID.
// 4) Your code must be able to compile; otherwise, you will receive a grade of zero.
// 5) Your code should not produce anything else other than the required information in the output
// file.
// 7) If you code is partially completed, please explain the details in the report what has been
// completed and the status of the missing parts, we will grade it based on the entire performance.
// 8) Provide sufficient comments in your code to help the TA understand your code. This is
// important for you to get at least partial credit in case your submitted code does not work properly.
