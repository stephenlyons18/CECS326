// Question 1:
// Sockets lecture describes certain port numbers as being well knownâ€”that is, they provide standard
// services. Port 17 is known as the quote-of-the-day service. When a client connects to port 17 on a
// server, the server responds with a quote for that day.
// Modify the date server shown in Figure 1 so that it delivers a quote of the day rather than the current
// date. The quotes should be printable ASCII characters and should contain fewer than 512 characters,
// although multiple lines are allowed. Since these well-known ports are reserved and therefore
// unavailable, have your server listen to port 6017. The date client can be used to read the quotes
// returned by your server.
// Figure 1. Data Server

mod QuoteClient;
mod QuoteServer;

fn main() {
    // create a new QuoteServer
    let mut server = QuoteServer::new(TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:6017").unwrap());

    // create a new QuoteClient
    let mut client = QuoteClient::new(TcpStream::connect("0.0.0.0:6017").unwrap());
    // read the quote from the QuoteServer
    client.read_quote();
