// Group Project 2: Synchronization
// CECS 326 â€“ Operating Systems
// You should submit the required deliverable materials on BeachBoard by 11:55pm, October 15th
// (Saturday), 2022. We provide sample code files that you can complete the required functions.
// 1. Description
// We provide an outline of a solution to the dining-philosophers problem using monitors. This project
// involves implementing a solution to this problem using either POSIX mutex locks and condition
// variables or Java condition variables.
// Both implementations will require creating five philosophers, each identified by a number 0 . . . 4.
// Each philosopher will run as a separate thread. Philosophers alternate between thinking and eating.
// To simulate both activities, have each thread sleep for a random period between one and three
// seconds.
// I. POSIX
// Thread creation using Pthreads (you can find how to use Pthreads with the APIs). When a
// philosopher wishes to eat, she invokes the function
// pickup_forks (int philosopher_number)
// where philosopher_number identifies the number of the philosopher wishing to eat. When a
// philosopher finishes eating, she invokes
// return_forks (int philosopher_number)
// Your implementation will require the use of POSIX condition variables, condition variables in
// Pthreads use the pthread_cond_t data type and are initialized using the pthread_cond_init()
// function. The following code creates and initializes a condition variable as well as its associated
// mutex lock:
// pthread_mutex_t mutex;
// pthread_cond_t cond_var;
// pthread_mutex_init(&mutex,NULL);
// pthread_cond_init(&cond_var,NULL);
// The pthread_cond_wait() function is used for waiting on a condition variable. The following code
// illustrates how a thread can wait for the condition a == b to become true using a Pthread condition
// variable:
// pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
// while (a != b)
// pthread_cond_wait(&cond_var, &mutex);
// pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
// The mutex lock associated with the condition variable must be locked before the
// pthread_cond_wait() function is called, since it is used to protect the data in the conditional clause
// from a possible race condition. Once this lock is acquired, the thread can check the condition. If
// the condition is not true, the thread then invokes pthread_cond_wait(), passing the mutex lock and
// the condition variable as parameters. Calling pthread_cond_wait() releases the mutex lock, thereby
// allowing another thread to access the shared data and possibly update its value so that the condition
// clause evaluates to true.
// II. Java
// When a philosopher wishes to eat, she invokes the method takeForks(philosopherNumber), where
// philosopherNumber identifies the number of the philosopher wishing to eat. When a philosopher
// finishes eating, she invokes returnForks(philosopherNumber).
// Your solution will implement the following interface:
// public interface DiningServer
// {
// /* Called by a philosopher when it wishes to eat */
// public void takeForks(int philosopherNumber);
// /* Called by a philosopher when it is finished eating */
// public void returnForks(int philosopherNumber);
// }
// It will require the use of Java condition variables,
// 2. The Required Deliverable Materials
// (1) A README file, which describes how we can compile and run your code.
// (2) Your source code, should submit in the required format.
// (3) Your short report, which discusses the design of your program.
// (4) A recorded video shows the output and runtime
// 3. Submission Requirements
// You need to strictly follow the instructions listed below:
// 1) This is a group project, please submit a .zip/.rar file that contains all files, only one submission
// from one group.
// 2) Make a video to record your code execution and outputs. The video should present your name
// or time as identification (You are suggested to upload the video to YouTube and put the link into
// your report).
// 3) The submission should include your source code and project report. Do not submit your binary
// code. Project report should contain your groupmates name and ID.
// 4) Your code must be able to compile; otherwise, you will receive a grade of zero.
// 5) Your code should not produce anything else other than the required information in the output
// file.
// 7) If you code is partially completed, please explain the details in the report what has been
// completed and the status of the missing parts, we will grade it based on the entire performance.
// 8) Provide sufficient comments in your code to help the TA understand your code. This is
// important for you to get at least partial credit in case your submitted code does not work properly.
// Grading criteria:
// Details Points
// Have a README file shows how to compile and test your submission 5 pts
// Submitted code has proper comments to show the design 15 pts
// Screen a video to record code execution and outputs 10 pts
// Have a report (pdf or word) file explains the details of your entire design 20 pts
// Report contains clearly individual contributions of your group mates 5 pts
// Code can be compiled and shows correct outputs 45 pts
// 4. Policies
// 1) Late submissions will be graded based on our policy discussed in the course syllabus.
// 2) Code-level discussion is prohibited. We will use anti-plagiarism tools to detect violations of
// this policy.
