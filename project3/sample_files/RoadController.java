// // 1. Problem Description
// // Consider that has this kind of scenario: two villages (Eastvillage and Westvillage) only have a
// // single-lane road for the connection. People from these two villages only can use this road for
// // exchange or share their produce. The road can be deadlocked if a people from either East or West
// // on the road simultaneously. To solve this problem to avoid deadlock, please design an algorithm
// // that uses semaphores and/or mutex locks. There have no concerns for the starvation cases.
// // Implement your solution using synchronization tools. In particular, represent the people at
// // Eastvillage and Westvillage as separate threads (east_village.java and west_village.java). Once a
// // people is on the road, the associated thread will sleep for a random period of time, representing
// // traveling across the road. You should design a new action for each people when they get into the
// // road, such as eat a donut, to wait for some time. Design your program so that you can create several
// // threads representing the two villagesâ€™ people without deadlock in the road.
// // You can flexibly design the algorithm, the test should have no deadlock in the multiple execution
// // cases.
// // 2. The Required Deliverable Materials
// // (1) A README file, which describes how we can compile and run your code.
// // (2) Your source code, should submit in the required format.
// // (3) Your short report, which discusses the design of your program.
// // (4) A recorded video shows the output and runtime
// // 3. Submission Requirements
// // You need to strictly follow the instructions listed below:
// // 1) This is a group project, please submit a .zip/.rar file that contains all files, only one submission
// // from one group.
// // 2) Make a video to record your code execution and outputs. The video should present your name
// // or time as identification (You are suggested to upload the video to YouTube and put the link into
// // your report).
// // 3) The submission should include your source code and project report. Do not submit your binary
// // code. Project report should contain your groupmates name and ID.
// // 4) Your code must be able to compile; otherwise, you will receive a grade of zero.
// // 5) Your code should not produce anything else other than the required information in the output
// // file.
// // 7) If you code is partially completed, please explain the details in the report what has been
// // completed and the status of the missing parts, we will grade it based on the entire performance.
// // 8) Provide sufficient comments in your code to help the TA understand your code. This is
// // important for you to get at least partial credit in case your submitted code does not work properly.
